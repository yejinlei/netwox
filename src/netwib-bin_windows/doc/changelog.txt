            |              NETWIB 's CHANGELOG           |
            ----------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.39.0 - 8-Jul-2012

 ++ fixed bugs ++
  - The function netwib_decodetype_init_kbd() returned an incorrect
    netwib_decodetype (incremented by one).
  - On a recent Linux kernel, netwib_ip_init_eth() always returned
    the NETWIB_ERR_FUIOCTL error, because SIOCGRARP is not
    supported.

 ++ minor evolutions ++
  - Update the url of the website: http://ntwib.sourceforge.net/
  - Corrected minor compiler warnings.
  - Add NETWIB_WINDOWSTYPE_2008 and NETWIB_WINDOWSTYPE_7 for
    netwib_windowstype_init().
  - On a recent Windows, we can have more than 20 devices, so we
    add the description in netwib_conf_devices.device, in order to
    show users why there are so many unknown devices on their
    systems.

 ++ compiler change ++
  - The Windows library (netwib.dll) is now compiled with Dev-C++
    (Mingw32), instead of Microsoft Visual. So, there is no
    "netwib[version].lib" anymore, which is replaced by
    "libnetwib[version].a". If you need this file, just recompile
    netwib with Microsoft Visual from sources as described in
    netwib-src/INSTALLWINDOWS.TXT.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.38.0 - 14-Feb-2010

 ++ minor evolutions ++
  - Add netwib__debug_ctrlc_pressed_break() to find memory leaks
    in debug mode.
  - Limit the number of recursive directories which can be created
    with netwib_dirname_create() to 100.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.37.0 - 19-Dec-2009

 ++ fixed bugs ++
  - Suppress gcc 4.3 warnings about unused functions.

 ++ major evolutions ++
  - Change GPLv2 to GPLv3.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.36.0 - 01-Nov-2008

 ++ fixed bugs ++
  - If a netwib_ips, netwib_eths or netwib_port contains too many
    values, a crash occurs. This crash is caused by the usage of a
    pointer which is not valid.
  - Installation directories were not created with mode 0755, so if
    root has a strict umask, users could not read the files in the
    directories.
  - The state of a netwib_io on a record was not initialized.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.35.0 - 05-Oct-2006

 ++ fixed bugs ++
  - Memory leak in netwib_dir_init() in cases where the dirname
    buffer could not be expanded.

 ++ major evolutions ++
  - Following functions were renamed, to homogenize their names
    ("string" instead of "text" or "str"):
     netwib_buf_cmp_str() to netwib_buf_cmp_string()
     netwib_buf_casecmp_str() to netwib_buf_casecmp_string()
     netwib_buf_init_ext_text() to netwib_buf_init_ext_string()
     netwib_buf_append_text() to netwib_buf_append_string()
  - Function netwib_buf_ref_string() was renamed to
    netwib_constbuf_ref_string() because it has a constant parameter.
    The new netwib_buf_ref_string() function has a non constant
    parameter. The macro netwib__constbuf_ref_string() is now public
    to manage an intermediary storage for appending the needed '\0'.
  - Type NETWIB_DECODETYPE_QUOTED for netwib_buf_decode() function
    is replaced by netwib_buf_decode_quoted() function.
  - Creation of NETWIB_BUF_FLAGS_SENSITIVE flags to wipe memory of
    sensitive buffers.

 ++ minor evolutions ++
  - Creation of netwib_io_init_shellserver() and shellclient() to
    provide a bash shell with a tty and readline. It is currently
    only implemented for Linux.
  - Add netwib_hash_ctl_get_count().

 ++ internal evolutions (not seen by end users) ++
  - Improvement in netwib_ring_index and netwib_hash_index to manage
    ring/hash changes during index looping. The supported functions,
    and their behavior, are commented in ringi.h and hashi.h.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.34.0 - 05-Apr-2006

 ++ fixed bugs ++
  - During compilation of libnetwib.so dynamic library, GCCLIB was
    missing.

 ++ major evolutions ++
  - Support of Tru64 Unix.

 ++ minor evolutions ++
  - New functions netwib_buf_casecmp(), netwib_buf_cmp_str() and
    netwib_buf_casecmp_str().

  - Support of gcc 4.0 compiler.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.32.0 - 24-November-2005

 ++ fixed bugs ++
  - Under Linux without IPv6 support, arp cache contains
    00:00:00:00:00:00 Ethernet addresses for unresolved entries.
  - In netwib_io_init_sniff_tcpreord(), only 8 of the 16 bits of
    TCP destination port were used to compare TCP sessions. This
    leads to a loss of packets.

 ++ major evolutions ++

 ++ internal evolutions (not seen by end users) ++
  - Improve netwib_io_init_sniff_tcpreord() function.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.31.0 - 12-October-2005

 ++ fixed bugs ++
  - Security: netwib_dir module contained a low risk vulnerability
    exploitable if:
     * netwib is used in a suid/sgid program and
     * this program is run on a system with a special filesystem
       (notes: I've never seen a filesystem matching the requested
        criteria. None of netwib users have a such system, otherwise
        they would have experienced a crash and reported it. So I
        think this vulnerability is almost never exploitable)
    Netwox is not vulnerable because it is not installed suid/sgid.
    Thanks to Ben Hutchings for reporting the problem. He found a
    generic problem affecting a lot of programs, but netwib code
    is special, and thus not affected as other programs.
    Netwib_dir module was partially rewritten to correct this
    problem and to improve its performance.
  - Memory leak in netwib_dir_init() if directory does not exists.

 ++ major evolutions ++
  - Function netwib_io_init_file() now supports reading and writing.

 ++ minor evolutions ++
  - New macro netwib_sock_ctl_get_socktype() obtains socket type.
  - Output value for netwib_ABC_compare_pf functions has a default
    value of NETWIB_CMP_LT.
  - Output value for netwib_ABC_criteria_pf functions has a default
    value of NETWIB_FALSE.
  - Function netwib_io_init_filetemp() opens file for read and write,
    instead of write only.
  - New macro netwib_file_ctl_set_truncate() truncates a file.

Version 5.30.0 - 30-March-2005

    Netw project is still paused.

 ++ fixed bugs ++
  - Macros netwib_c2_uint16_2, netwib_c2_uint32_4, netwib_c2_uint64_8
    netwib_c2_uint64_set_8 and netwib_c2_uint64_set_32 did not work
    if parameters were signed.

 ++ major evolutions ++

    TTL for multicast packets.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.29.0 - 21-February-2005
 ++ important ++
    As some of you noticed, netw project paused since January 1st.
    This is due to my professional/enterprise project where I have to
    do a lot of private work. It should end on september, so I expect
    to be back on netw on october. In the meantime, bugs will be
    corrected, but no major tool is expected. Note: don't worry, my
    boss is not forcing me to work on WE, but I want this project to
    take a giant step :-)

Version 5.26.0 - 25-October-2004
 ++ fixed bugs ++
  - Under Solaris, network devices with two or more IP addresses were
    not retrieved in network configuration. The first address was set
    but not the others.
  - Under BSD, additional routing table entries were not retrieved.
    It was due to specially formed socket addresses not been decoded.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.25.0 - 27-September-2004
 ++ fixed bugs ++
  - A change introduced in version 5.24.0 caused a compiler error on
    computers without 64 bit integers support. It was necessary to
    edit netwib source to correct the error in order to compile.

 ++ major evolutions ++
  - A new error code was created: NETWIB_ERR_DATAMISSING. It is used
    by packet decoding functions to indicate packet could not be
    decoded because of insufficient data (!= malformed data).

 ++ minor evolutions ++
  - Creation of defines to simplify uint64 conversion.

  - Lists of addresses or ports (netwib_ips, netwib_eths or
    netwib_ports) can be sorted, or not, depending on user choice.

 ++ minor evolutions ++
  - Random number generator uses a 64 bit linear congruential
    generator (before, it was a 31 bit generator). It provides a
    longer period.

Version 5.23.0 - 30-August-2004
 ++ fixed bugs ++
  - Under Yellow Dog Linux, a crash occurred in netwib_buf_append_fmt
    and similar functions. It was due to a va_list passed as value
    to sub-functions, instead of passed as reference/pointer. A
    va_list is special and should be treated as opaque. Thanks to
    Joseph E. Sacco for reporting and solving the problem.

  - Functions netwib_c_memmem and netwib_c_memcasemem crashed trying
    to read past end of buffers.
  - On systems where poll() does not exists (Windows for example),
    selecting an infinite wait on file descriptor caused a NULL
    pointer to be used. This crashed the program.

  - Program genemake guesses system and architecture, without the
    need to edit config.dat.
  - Creation of netwib_int64 and netwib_uint64 types containing 64
    bit integers where available (natively on 64 bit computers, or
    using compiler extensions on 32 bit computers).
  - Creation of netwib_uintptr of same size as pointers, whereas
    netwib_intmax can now store a 64 bit integer even on 32 bit
    computers.

 ++ minor evolutions ++
  - Creation of function netwib_buf_append_localtime to display a
    localtime.
  - Field yday in netwib_localtime corresponds to the real day
    number, and not the offset since January 1.
  - Function netwib_pathstat_init replaces function
    netwib_pathnametype_init.
  - Flag NETWIB_BUF_FLAGS_NEEDTOALLOC was somewhat redundant with
    NETWIB_BUF_FLAGS_CANALLOC.

  - IMPORTANT: netwib's license changed from LGPL to GPL (netwox and
    netwag are already GPL). In a world were more and more commercial
    enterprises earn money using Open Source developers' work, but
    never contribute to community, I do not think LGPL is appropriate
    anymore for netwib. If you want to use netwib/ox/ag in a
    commercial application, just contribute, and I'll arrange a
    special license for your needs.

    optional buffer. This type of buffer is allocated only when
    it is really needed.
  - Module bufpool now supports memory shared between several
    threads.

  - Functions using netwib_buf_ref_string on parameters now use
    an internal buffer.

  - Function netwib_buf_append_char was renamed to
    netwib_buf_append_byte.
  - Function netwib_io_init_sock_tcp_ser is no more blocking
    awaiting for a client to connect. Function netwib_io_wait can
    now be used for waiting.

 ++ minor evolutions ++
  - Support for gcc 3.3.2 (and others) having -fstrict-aliasing in
    default O2 optimization. Flag -fno-strict-aliasing is now set.
    Note: ISO C changed to be more strict. However, this leads to
    complex code when two types are not exactly the same (forced
    usage of unions instead of cast). The major problem for netwib
    is allocator functions and ring/hash functions. Those functions
    are clean (there is no bug) but when the compiler optimize them,
    it introduce bugs... After looking around to see how other
    projects are dealing with this, I found that most of them are
    deactivating the optimization feature. So, I'll do as my
    friends : gcc -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing.
  - Function netwib_dir_next now returns canonized filenames.
  - Creation of function netwib_unix_symlink.

 ++ internal evolutions (not seen by end users) ++
  - Under Windows, function LoadLibrary is now wrapped in a common
    function searching in system directories first. This is better
    for users loading netwib at run time, but it does not help
    when a program, such as netwox, is linked with netwib.
  - Several files contained tabulations instead of spaces.

Version 5.3.0 - 19-Oct-2003

 ++ bugs fixed ++
  - Under Windows, functions netwib_filename_rename and
    netwib_dirname_rename did not work if destination file previously
    existed. This bug is the same as the one corrected in 5.2.0. This
    is not really clear to me, nor in msdn documentation, but rename
    can return errno EEXIST or EACCES depending on context. So now I
    just hope all error cases are checked :)
  - In functions displaying packets, if an header is not decoded,
    it is printed as data. However, a transition was not printed in
    this case. So, a space or a newline was not printed between the
    header and the data.
  - UDP header decoding had an useless/invalid test causing valid
    headers to be rejected.

 ++ major evolutions ++
  - A netwib_buf can be configured using a bitfield. A new kind of
    buffer management is provided : if an external array is too
    short, an allocated memory is used instead.
  - Several performance improvements in sys/io module.

 ++ minor evolutions ++
  - Creation of functions netwib_buf_append_pkt_data and
    netwib_pkt_data_display.
  - In netwib_localtime, a new parameter, named zoneoffset,
    corresponds to offset between localtime and GMT.

  - Use of the new feature provided by dat/buf module.
  - Use of the new features provided by sys/io module.

Version 5.2.0 - 05-Oct-2003

 ++ bugs fixed ++
  - Under Windows, functions netwib_filename_rename and
    netwib_dirname_rename did not work if destination file previously
    existed.
  - In function netwib_threadlist_wait, when waiting for an infinite
    time (NETWIB_TIME_INFINITE), parameter pevent was not set.
  - In function netwib_io_init_sock, there was a memory leak if
    the socket could not be opened.

  - Function netwib_buf_init_ext_text can now be initialized
    with a NULL pointer. It will store an empty buffer.

Version 5.1.0 - 23-Sep-2003

 ++ bugs fixed ++
  - Functions netwib_c_memmem, netwib_c_strcasecmp,
    netwib_c_strcasestr and netwib_c_strncasecmp were not exported
    in netwib51.dll. So, they were not available under Windows.
  - In netwib-doc_html, links were missing in section files, so
    it was not possible to navigate in the different modules.
  - Function netwib_eth_init_ip always returned NETWIB_ERR_OK (even
    if address was not resolved).
  - When not called after a configuration function, functions
    netwib_eth_init_ip and netwib_ip_init_eth could not resolve
    address of a local device.
  - Under Linux, netwib_ips_add_buf could not add the local
    IP address (because getaddrinfo also returned an AF_UNIX).
  - In netwib_buf_append_icmp4code, "unknown" was displayed even
    if code was 0 for NETWIB_ICMP4TYPE_ECHOREP/SRCQUENCH/ECHOREQ/
    TIMESTAMPREQ/TIMESTAMPREP/INFOREQ/INFOREP.
  - Functions netwib_encodetype_init_kbd and
    netwib_record_encodetype_init_kbd returned pressed key number
    instead of associated encodetype value.
  - Function netwib_buf_encode did not store last line
    for NETWIB_ENCODETYPE_DUMP/MIXEDH_WRAP.
  - Function netwib_io_init_file did not truncate the file
    when opening it in write mode.
  - Function netwib_buf_append_pkt_ip displayed udp/tcp/icmp
    fragments as normal packets.

 ++ major evolutions ++
  - Name changed to netwib.
  - Parts of module dat/buf.c were rewritten to improve its
    performance and ease of use.
  - Meaning of netwib_time in netwib_io_wait has changed. Before,
    it corresponded to a duration (ie 3 seconds). Now, it is
    the absolute ending time (ie 2003/08/15 at 13:23:10). Like
    this, it is more efficient and easier to use (even if it
    does not at first sight). All other functions having a wait
    parameter have also changed.

 ++ minor evolutions ++
  - Define NETWIB_CHAR_INIT_KBD_NODEF was missing, so developer had
    to use 0 instead.
  - Function netwib_fmt_display now displays a netwib_bool as
    "true" "false" "yes" "no" etc. instead of only "0"/"1".
  - Function netwib_fmt_display now displays a netwib_cmp as
    "<" "=" ">" "lt" "eq" etc. instead of only "-1"/"0"/"+1".
  - In function netwib_fmt_decode, "%$" can be used to indicate
    string end.
  - Function netwib_io_init_sniff_ip now has one more parameter
    named ipreas.
  - Function netwib_io_init_spoof_ip now has one more parameter
    named inittype.
  - Creation of functions netwib_time_init_localtime and
    netwib_time_decode_localtime.
  - Creation of functions netwib_device_hwtype_init_kbd and
    netwib_device_dlttype_init_kbd.
  - Creation of function netwib_pkt_convert.
  - Now, a record file not ending with an empty line is accepted.
    Before, last packet was not read if user edited file by hand
    and forgot to put the newline.
  - Creation of function netwib_c_memcasemem.
  - Function netwib_buf_append_ips has one more parameter to
    specify how to display a netwib_ips.
  - Creation of type NETWIB_DECODETYPE_DATA.
  - Creation of function netwib_wait_init_thread_cond.
  - Creation of function netwib_buf_append_rand.
  - Creation of module dat/bufpool, to deal with a pool of buffers.
  - Creation of function netwib_io_init_data.

 ++ internal evolutions (not seen by end users) ++
  - Due to several incompatibility problems between systems,
    sys/priv/kbd.c was partially rewritten. Changes in
    character echo or line reading are now immediate.
  - Simplification of net/priv/sa.c dealing with sockaddr.
