 August2004/5.23.0 : Under Yellow Dog Linux, a crash occurred in
                     netwib_buf_append_fmt and similar functions.
                     It was due to a va_list passed as value to
                     sub-functions, instead of passed as
                     reference/pointer. A va_list is special
                     and should be treated as opaque.
