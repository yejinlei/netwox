Tasks for occasional developers [once developed and integrated, no
support is needed from developer] :

 * Run tests in netw-ib-ox-ag-5.x.y.tgz to find bugs. This test suite can
   be run on every system you have.

 * Improve library tests in netw-ib-ox-ag-5.x.y.tgz. Branch 5 is quite young,
   so it contains bugs. The testing suite does not detect all of them.
   All test cases for every function should be implemented.

 * Run gprof to find slow functions in the library and to optimize
   them. Gprof can be run with help of netwox or netw-ib-ox-ag-5.x.y.tgz.
   One of the first things to profile is netwib_conf_display which is
   slow on some systems (ie OpenBSD or Windows).

 * I should take time to review the old code.

Tasks for long time developers [once developed and integrated, some
support may be needed from developer] :

 * Port to other systems :
    - Tru64 UNIX
    - AIX
    - etc.
   In this case, long time support is needed, because I do not have
   a shell access to any of those systems. So, I might contact you
   for updates or user problems.

 * Currently netwib works for Ethernet cards and PPP modems. Support
   could be added for :
    - 802.11
    - FDDI
    - Token Ring (obsolete ?)
    - etc.
   In this case, long time support is needed, because I do not have
   systems with such hardware. So, I might contact you for updates
   or user problems.

Netwib does not support IPv6 under Windows (configuration and sockets).
Anyone wants to buy me a Windows 2003 Server license ?
