
If you find errors, thanks for contacting me.

For every bug report, try to indicate :
 - netwib/netwox/netwag version
 - libpcap/winpcap version
 - libnet version (Unix only)
 - result of the command : netwox 2
 - system (uname -a under unix)
 - command or error environment
 - how to reproduce the error
 - the patch, if you wrote one
 - other information you may think useful

How to create a patch (Unix only) ?
- Solution 1 : 
   One file was modified : compare the modified file with the
   original file :
     diff -ub file.c.original file.c > /tmp/file.c.patch
- Solution 2 :
   Several files were modified : compare the modified directory with the
   original directory :
     diff -urbaN netwib-5.39.0-src netwib-5.39.0-src.modified > /tmp/dir.patch
- Suggestion :
   If you haven't done the changes, use preferably this method :
     cd ../..
     cp -R netwib-5.39.0-src netwib-5.39.0-src.modified
     cd netwib-5.39.0-src.modified
     [do your modifications, compilations, tests, etc.]
     cd ..
     diff -urbaN netwib-5.39.0-src netwib-5.39.0-src.modified > /tmp/dir.patch

Then, I'll apply the patch with :
  patch -Nbp1 < file.c.patch 
  patch -Nbp0 < dir.patch
