                   |   INTEGRATION OF NETWIB  |
                   ----------------------------

Netwib allows for easy creation of network programs. In order to
achieve this, it contains several high level features, hiding some
actions.
However, when netwib is expected to be integrated in a complex program :
 - hidden features might interfere with those wanted by the
   developer, or
 - access to low level resources might by difficult if not impossible.


Here are some points to analyze before integrating netwib in a big program :

 - Netwib is designed for text programs (console).
   Netwib can be used in graphical mode, but functions xyz_display and
   xyz_kbd_xyz will not work.
   Under Windows, programs using netwib539.dll have to be compiled with the
   type "Win32 Console Application" under Visual C++ or "Win32 Console"
   under Dev-C++.

 - Events of kind sniff, spoof, etc. can only be accessed through the use
   of a netwib_wait (so functions select (Unix) or WaitForxyzObjects (Windows)
   cannot be used).
   So user'events have to be converted to netwib_wait. There are two ways
   to do it :
    - use netwib_wait_init_function_event, or
    - use netwib_io_init_fd or netwib_io_init_handle to initialize
      a netwib_io. Then, use netwib_wait_init_io_xyz.

 - Under Unix, file descriptors do not have the flag "close on exec".
   Developers might want to set it on concerned descriptors before
   calling a sensitive external program.


Do not hesitate to ask me questions about integration of particular
programs.
