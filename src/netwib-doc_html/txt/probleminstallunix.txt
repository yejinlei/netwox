This file describes known problems (incompatibilities, unsupported
features, errors, etc.).
If you seek help (usage help, examples, etc.), it's better to read 
netwib-5.39.0-doc_html.tgz. You can also use "man netwib".

Problems described in this file are (if you encounter an unknown problem,
thanks for contacting me, as explained in ./doc/problemreport.txt):

Problem 1:
  Problem synthesis:
    exec ether_hostton ko
       Warning: you are on a computer with a bad ether_hostton.
                The library netwib will still be usable, but read 
                ../doc/probleminstallunix.txt if you want to use the file
                /etc/ethers.
    [problem in /etc/nsswitch.conf]
  Environment affected by the problem:
    Glibc-2.?? (<2.2.1) with "nisplus" or "db" in /etc/nsswitch.conf
  What's causing the problem:
    The problem arises when calling the function ether_hostton, and when
    the entry "nisplus" or "db" is in /etc/nsswitch.conf.
    Indeed, there is an error in glibc source (glibc-2.1.3):
      nis/nss_nisplus/nisplus-ethers.c, line 234: 
        there is "if (name != NULL)" instead of "if (name == NULL)"
    Note: an email was sent to glibc developers. They applied a patch
          in glibc 2.2.1.
  Solution 1:
    Edit /etc/nsswitch.conf to replace the line:
         ethers: _here_nisplus_or_nis_or_db_is_written_ files
    by:
         ethers: files
    Indeed, the problems disappears when removing "nis", "nisplus" or "db".
    You should then execute "genemake" again (and compile and install)
    to ensure that netwib will use ether_hostton.
  Solution 2:
    Install glibc > 2.2.1.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 2:
  Problem synthesis:
    exec ether_hostton ko
       Warning: you are on a computer with a bad ether_hostton.
                The library netwib will still be usable, but read 
                ../doc/probleminstallunix.txt if you want to use the file
                /etc/ethers.
    [problem in /etc/ethers]
  Environment affected by the problem:
    /etc/ethers empty
  What's causing the problem:
    The problem arises when /etc/ethers exists, but is empty.
    Indeed, there is an error in glibc source (glibc-2.1.3):
      inet/ether_hton.c, line 76:
        fct has only four parameters, instead of five
    Note: an email was sent to glibc developers. They applied a patch
          in glibc 2.2.1.
  Solution 1:
    Remove the file /etc/ethers if it doesn't contain any line.
  Solution 2:
    Install glibc > 2.2.1.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 3:
  Problem synthesis:
    ./genemake: Permission denied.
  Environment affected by the problem:
    All
  What's causing the problem:
    file-5.39.0-src.tgz wasn't uncompressed with a good program.
  Solution:
    Use:
         tar -zxvf file-5.39.0-src.tgz
    or
         gunzip file-5.39.0-src.tgz ; tar -xvf file-5.39.0-src.tar

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 4:
  Problem synthesis:
    Warning: the directory '/usr/.../xyz' doesn't exists.
  Environment affected by the problem:
    All
  What's causing the problem:
    The directory named 'xyz' does not exist on your system.
  Solution 1:
    Create the directory with:
         mkdir /usr/.../xyz
  Solution 2:
    Edit ../src/config.dat to specify an alternative installation directory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 5:
  Problem synthesis:
    Error: the library libpcap is not installed.
  Environment affected by the problem:
    All
  What's causing the problem:
    The library libpcap doesn't seem to be installed
  Solution 1:
    Libpcap isn't completely installed or configured
    Install it from http://www.tcpdump.org/.
  Solution 2:
    Verify that all packages are installed on your system.
    For example, for Debian, you have to install libpcapxx.deb
    (for the dynamic library) and libpcap-devxx.deb (for pcap.h).
  Solution 3:
    [if the error is about pcap.h]
    The file pcap.h is not located in a good directory:
        locate "pcap.h"
    If you find it in /somewhere/pcap.h, then link it:
        ln -s /somewhere/pcap.h /usr/local/include/pcap.h
    Note: "/usr/local/include/" might not be in the path searched
          by the compiler (this is the case for the gcc optional package of
          Solaris8), so use "/usr/include/" for example.
  Solution 4:
    [if the error is about bpf.h]
    The file bpf.h is not located in a good directory:
         locate "bpf.h"
    If you find it in /somewhere/bpf.h, then link it:
         ln -s /somewhere/bpf.h /usr/local/include/net/bpf.h
    Note: "/usr/local/include/" might not be in the path searched
          by the compiler (this is the case for the gcc optional package of
          Solaris8), so use "/usr/include/" for example.
  Solution 5:
    [if the error is about bpf.h]
    The file /usr/local/include/net/bpf.h or /usr/include/net/bpf.h
    is not on your system.
    Search the cdrom of your distribution to find the file "bpf.h",
    and install the corresponding missing package.
  Solution 6:
    [if the error is about -lpcap]
    The file libpcap.a/libpcap.so is not located in a good directory:
        locate "libpcap.a" ; locate "libpcap.so"
    If you find it in /somewhere/libpcap.a_or_so, then link it:
        ln -s /somewhere/libpcap.a /usr/local/lib/libpcap.a
        ln -s /somewhere/libpcap.so /usr/local/lib/libpcap.so
    Note: "/usr/local/lib/" might not be in the path searched
          by the compiler (this is the case for the gcc optional package of
          Solaris8), so use "/usr/lib/" for example.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Solution 4:
    [if the error is about bpf.h]
    The file bpf.h is not located in a good directory:

Problem 8:
  Problem synthesis:
    /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lpcap.
  Environment affected by the problem:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 9:
  Problem synthesis:
    Warning: integer constant is unsigned in ANSI C, signed with -traditional.
  Environment affected by the problem:
    FreeBSD 3.1, FreeBSD 4.0, Solaris 2.8
  What's causing the problem:
    This error is in the definition of SIOCGIFCONF, which
    uses a signed number.
  Solution:
    You should edit /usr/include/sys/ioccom.h to correct IOC_IN:
        "#define IOC_IN 0x80000000u" instead of
        "#define IOC_IN 0x80000000"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 10:
  Problem synthesis:
    Warning: implicit declaration of function `ether_hostton'.
  Environment affected by the problem:
    Solaris 2.x
  What's causing the problem:
    The functions "ether_hostton" and "ether_ntohost" are never
    defined.
  Solution:
    You should edit "/usr/include/netinet/if_ether.h" to add:
            int ether_hostton(char *hostname, struct ether_addr *e);
            int ether_ntohost(char *hostname, struct ether_addr *e);

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 11:
  Problem synthesis:
    Error: stat.c: aggregate value used where integer was expected.
  Environment affected by the problem:
    Solaris 2.7
  What's causing the problem:
    Older includes contain a typedef for u_longlong_t and
    longlong_t in /usr/include/sys/types.h. It defines them as an union
    to support older compilers. They have to be redefined as 'long long'
    if you have a recent compiler. In other cases, edit netwib/inc/maininc.h
    to undefine support for 64 bit file access (undefine _LARGEFILE_SOURCE
    and _FILE_OFFSET_BITS).
  Solution:
    You should edit "/usr/include/sys/types.h" to replace:
      typedef union ... longlong_t;
      typedef union ... u_longlong_t;
    by:
      typedef long long longlong_t;
      typedef unsigned long long u_longlong_t;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 12:
  Problem synthesis:
    Error: /usr/include/linux/xyz.h: No such file or directory
    Error: /usr/include/asm/xyz.h: No such file or directory
    Error: linux/xyz.h: No such file or directory
    Error: asm/xyz.h: No such file or directory
  Environment affected by the problem:
    Linux
  What's causing the problem:
    Standard includes are needed to compile.
  Solution 1:
    Install the package libc6-dev_xyz
    For example, under Debian: libc6-dev_2.x.x-xx.deb.
  Solution 2:
    The new kernel includes have to be reachable by the compiler.
    For example:
        ln -s /usr/src/linux-x.x.xx/include/asm /usr/include/asm
        ln -s /usr/src/linux-x.x.xx/include/linux /usr/include/linux

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 13:
  Problem synthesis:
    Warning: SIG_IGN: function declaration isn't a prototype
    Warning: SIG_DFL: function declaration isn't a prototype
    Warning: SIG_xyz: function declaration isn't a prototype
  Environment affected by the problem:
    Solaris
  What's causing the problem:
    Prototype for SIG_xyz is incorrect.
  Solution:
    Edit /usr/include/sys/iso/signal_iso.h (or
    /usr/include/sys/signal.h) to replace:
        #define SIG_IGN (void(*)())1
    by:
        #define SIG_IGN (void(*)(int))1

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 14:
  Problem synthesis:
    Warning in /usr/include/bits/string2.h
  Environment affected by the problem:
    Linux
  What's causing the problem:
    Standard inlines do not compile without warning.
  Solution 1:
    Edit netwib/inc/maininc.h to add
        #define __NO_INLINE__ 1
  Solution 2:
    Edit /usr/include/string.h at line 359 (may vary, it's just
    before "#include <bits/string2.h>") to add
        #define __NO_STRING_INLINES 1
