There are 3 steps :
 - compile and install libpcap [if not already installed]
 - compile and install libnet [if not already installed]
 - compile and install libnetwib.a


                 -------------------------------
                 |       STEP 1 : libpcap      |
                 -------------------------------

If libpcap isn't installed on your system, you have to do it :
 - http://www.tcpdump.org/, or
 - from a package for your system (look the cdrom or website
   of your distribution)
Installation procedure for libpcap is explained in downloaded
files, or depends on tools from your distribution. On some
distributions, there are two packages to install : libpcap
and libpcap-devel.

Note: If libpcap is not installed, netwib will work, but without
      sniffing features.


                 -------------------------------
                 |       STEP 2 : libnet       |
                 -------------------------------

If libnet isn't installed on your system, you have to do it :
 - http://www.packetfactory.net/libnet, or
 - from a package for your system (look the cdrom or website
   of your distribution)
Version >= 1.0 is necessary.
Installation procedure for libnet is explained in downloaded
files, or depends on tools from your distribution. On some
distributions, there are two packages to install : libnet
and libnet-devel.

Note: If libnet is not installed, netwib will work, but without
      spoofing features.


                 -------------------------------
                 |     STEP 3 : libnetwib.a    |
                 -------------------------------

 - "cd src"          (to go in sources subdirectory)
 - "./genemake"      (generate the files Makefile and netwib/def.h)
 - "make"            (compile the library)
 - "make install"    (install the library : include files, libnetwib.a
                      and manpages are installed. You need to be root
                      to do it)

Note : if you prefer installing libnetwib.so, use (after "./genemake") 
       "make libnetwib.so" and "make installso".


                 ------------------------------
                 |          NEXT STEP         |
                 ------------------------------

If you want to compile a program needing netwib library, that's all.

If you want to create your own program using netwib library :
 - Download netw-ib-ox-ag-5.39.0.tgz which shows how to use each function (directory test/netwib).
 - Read ./doc/compilunix.txt.
 - Download and read netwib-5.39.0-doc_html.tgz to obtain information
   about netwib.
