This package permits to COMPILE netwib539.dll. If you seek a 
pre-compiled version, download netwib-5.39.0-bin_windows.tgz.

Note : if you encounter problems, read ./doc/probleminstallwindows.txt

There are 2 steps :
 - install winpcap version >= 3.0
 - compile and install netwib539.dll


                 -------------------------------
                 |       STEP 1 : winpcap      |
                 -------------------------------

If winpcap isn't installed on your system, download it from :
  http://winpcap.polito.it/
Version 3.0, or superior, is needed.
Follow the given instructions in order to install it.

After installing winpcap, you should test if it is working properly.
If you do not want to bother testing, you can directly go to step 2.
To test winpcap's installation, you need to download windump :
  http://windump.polito.it/
Then, in a console window, if you enter "\directory...\windump",
network packet will be displayed (for example, you can ping another
computer and see the packets).
Once windump displays network packets, you can go to step2.

If you have a problem downloading, installing winpcap, or running 
windump, read the faq at :
  http://winpcap.polito.it/
  http://windump.polito.it/
If you still have a problem, contact Winpcap's developers.
I cannot help you, because I do not maintain this code.

Note: If winpcap is not installed, netwib will work, but without
      sniffing or spoofing features.


                 ------------------------------
                 |    STEP 2 : netwib539.dll   |
                 ------------------------------

You need a compiler :
 - Visual C++ (tested with version 6)
 - Dev-C++/Mingw32 (tested with version 5 beta)

Rename "src/netwib/def_windows.h" to "src/netwib/def.h".

Visual C++ procedure :
 - Open the Workspace file "src/compil/windows/netwib/netwib.dsw".
 - Select Release (instead of Debug) as "Active Configuration" under Build.
 - Press F7 key, to build everything.
 - The following files should be generated :
     src/compil/windows/netwib/Release/netwib539.lib
     src/compil/windows/netwib/Release/netwib539.dll
   So, we obtain netwib539.lib and netwib539.dll.

Dev-C++ procedure :
 - Open the project file "src/compil/devcpp/netwib.dev".
 - Press Ctrl-F9 key, to build everything.
 - The following files should be generated :
     src/compil/devcpp/out/libnetwib539.a
     src/compil/devcpp/out/netwib539.dll
   So, we obtain libnetwib539.a and netwib539.dll.

Copy netwib539.dll to
 - "c:\Windows\System\netwib539.dll"   [under Windows 95, 98, Me]
 - "c:\winnt\System32\netwib539.dll"   [under Windows NT, 2000]
 - "c:\windows\System32\netwib539.dll" [under Windows XP]

Create a directory which will contain material for building 
projects using netwib (for example "c:\netwib539\").

Copy netwib539.lib (Visual C++) or libnetwib539.a (Dev-C++) to 
"c:\netwib539\lib\".

Copy "src\*.h" to "c:\netwib539\include\*.h".


                 ------------------------------
                 |          NEXT STEP         |
                 ------------------------------

If you want to compile a program needing netwib library, that's all.

If you want to create your own program using netwib library :
 - Download netw-ib-ox-ag-5.39.0.tgz which shows how to use each function (directory test/netwib).
 - Read ./doc/compilwindows.txt.
 - Download and read netwib-5.39.0-doc_html.tgz to obtain information
   about netwib.
