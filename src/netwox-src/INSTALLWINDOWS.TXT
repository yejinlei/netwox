This package permits to COMPILE netwox539.exe. If you seek a 
pre-compiled version, download netwox-5.39.0-bin_windows.tgz.

Note : if you encounter problems, read ./doc/probleminstallwindows.txt

There are 2 steps :
 - compile and install netwib [if not already installed]
 - compile and install netwox


                  ------------------------------
                  |       STEP 1 : netwib      |
                  ------------------------------

If netwib isn't installed on your system, you have to do it :
   http://ntwib.sourceforge.net/
Installation procedure for netwib is explained in downloaded files.

                  |      STEP 2 : netwox      |
                  -----------------------------

You need a compiler :
 - Visual C++ (tested with version 6)
 - Dev-C++/Mingw32 (tested with version 5 beta)

Rename "src/def_windows.h" to "src/def.h".
Rename "src/netwib_windows.h" to "src/netwib.h".

Visual C++ procedure :
 - Open the Workspace file "src/compil/windows/netwox/netwox.dsw".
 - Select Release (instead of Debug) as "Active Configuration" under Build.
 - Open the menu "Setup", "Settings...". Then, select "C/C++", select
   category "Preprocessor". In the field "Additional include directories",
   there is "..\..\..\..\..\netwib-bin_windows\include". Change this
   value to "C:\netwib\include" (this is the directory's name where you
   put netwib's includes during netwib's installation). Press "OK".
 - Open the menu "Setup", "Settings...". Then, select "Link", select
   category "Input". In the field "Additional library path",
   there is "..\..\..\..\..\netwib-bin_windows\lib". Change this value
   to "C:\netwib\lib" (this is the directory's name where you put
   netwib's lib during netwib's installation). Press "OK".
 - Press F7 key, to build everything.
 - The following file should be generated :
     src/compil/windows/netwox/Release/netwox539.exe
 - So, we obtain netwox539.exe.

Dev-C++ procedure :
 - Open the project file "src/compil/devcpp/netwox.dev".
 - Open the menu "Project", "Project options", "Parameters", "Directories".
   In the field "Include Directories" there is "..\..\..\..\..\src\
   netwib-bin_windows\include". Change this value to "C:\netwib\include"
   (this is the directory's name where you put netwib's includes during
   netwib's installation). Press "OK".
 - Open the menu "Project", "Project options", "Parameters".
   In the field "Linker" there is "../../../../netwib-bin_windows
   /lib/libnetwib539.a". Change this value to "C:\netwib\lib\libnetwib539.a"
   (this is the directory's name where you put netwib's lib during
   netwib's installation, followed by the library file). Press "OK".
 - Press Ctrl-F9 key, to build everything.
 - The following files should be generated :
     src/compil/devcpp/out/netwox539.exe
 - So, we obtain netwox539.exe.

Copy netwox539.exe in a directory of your path (for example,
"%WINDIR%\Command\" or "%WINDIR%\System32\").
