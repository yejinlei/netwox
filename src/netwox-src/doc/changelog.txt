            ----------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.39.0 - 8-Jul-2012

 ++ fixed bugs ++
  - Tool 117 (recursive deletion of a FTP directory) failed to remove
    the directory when it was not the root directory.
  - Tool 180 (NTP client) incorrectly checked the version in received
    packets.

 ++ minor evolutions ++
  - Update the url of the website: http://ntwox.sourceforge.net/
  - Corrected minor compiler warnings.

 ++ compiler change ++
  - The Windows binary (netwox.exe) is now compiled with Dev-C++
    (Mingw32), instead of Microsoft Visual. If you want to compile
    your own binary with Microsoft Visual from sources, just read
    netwox-src/INSTALLWINDOWS.TXT.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.38.0 - 14-Feb-2010

 ++ fixed bugs ++
  - Tool 161 (SNMP Trap) used a timestamp of type Integer instead of
    TimeTicks. Thanks to Tom for reporting it.

 ++ minor evolutions ++
  - Use netwib__debug_ctrlc_pressed_break() to find memory leaks
    in debug mode.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.37.0 - 19-Dec-2009

 ++ fixed bugs ++
  - Suppress gcc 4.3 warnings about unused functions.
  - Correct a memory leak when decoding DNS packets. This leak was
    due to a missing netwox_dnsrr_close() call in the
    netwox_pkt_decode_dns_question() function. Thanks to Nilesh
    Khambal for reporting it.

 ++ major evolutions ++
  - Change GPLv2 to GPLv3.
  - Add tool 223 to forward an email.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.36.0 - 01-Nov-2008

 ++ fixed bugs ++
  - In netwox_httphdr_host(), a ':' was missing between the host and
    the port number, so the Host header was set with "www.s.dom8080"
    instead of "www.s.dom:8080".
  - Installation directories were not created with mode 0755, so if
    root has a strict umask, users could not read the files in the
    directories.

 ++ minor evolutions ++
  - The 'Q' parameter in tool 7 can be used to lose privileges after
    the snif device has been open.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.35.0 - 05-Oct-2006

 ++ fixed bugs ++
  - Some whois servers wants the query and the newline to be sent in
    the same TCP packet.

 ++ major evolutions ++
  - In the webspider, the local url algorithm was rewritten. Files
    are now stored in directories whose name are not related to real
    url path. This suppress limitations such as maxsegmentlen and
    maxtotallen. This also optimizes the number of files in
    directories. New mimetypes, mimetypeswarn and deletedextensions
    parameters are available (run "netwox 137 file" for help on
    these parameters).
  - Parameters of webspider tools 211 and 212 changed. These tools
    associate urls and their local downloaded filenames.
  - New tool 222 to suppress local urls/uris in a HTML file.

 ++ minor evolutions ++
    None in this version

 ++ internal evolutions (not seen by end users) ++
  - Partial usage of NETWIB_BUF_FLAGS_SENSITIVE.

 ++ major evolutions ++
  - Implementation of MD2, RIPEMD-128, RIPEMD-160, SHA-1, SHA-224,
    SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512 cryptographic hash functions.
  - Tool 219: compute cryptographic hash of a file (md5, sha, etc.)
  - Tool 220 and 221: encode and decode a base64 file.

 ++ minor evolutions ++
  - Tool 218: run internal test suite (for netwox developers).
  - In tool 22, add support for other cryptographic hash functions.

 ++ internal evolutions (not seen by end users) ++
  - Modules are moved in sub-directories.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.32.0 - 24-November-2005

 ++ fixed bugs ++
  - Tool 19 : range check was incorrect.
  - Function netwox_mime_hdrencode() did not correctly encode some
    characters. This function is used in mail and nntp clients.

 ++ major evolutions ++
  - Tool 217 is a SMB/CIFS server. Microsoft Windows and Samba
    clients can be used to connect to this server.

 ++ minor evolutions ++
    None in this version

 ++ internal evolutions (not seen by end users) ++
  - Improvements in smb modules in order to support Windows 95, 98,
    Me, NT4, 2000, XP, Samba 2/3. Note: I don't have access to a
    Windows 2003 computer, so I can't check it works.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.31.0 - 12-October-2005

 ++ fixed bugs ++
  - In SMB clients, --netbiosname parameter had a bad default value.
    User needed to always set the value to overwrite this bad
    default.
  - In SMB clients, do not use Unicode/NTerror before it has been
    negotiated.
  - In web spider, do not try to convert special attributes, such as
    object classid="special", to uris.
  - Traceroute tools displayed an error after sending last hop
    packet. Thanks to Marc Turpin for reporting the problem.

 ++ major evolutions ++
  - In tcp/udp performance tools, display better error messages. For
    udp, the number of packets sent/received is also displayed.

 ++ minor evolutions ++
  - In web spider, a new option displays the current number of
    downloaded files over the total number to download (loglevel 5).
  - Detail description of tree top entries.

 ++ work in progress ++
  - Tool 217 is a SMB server. It contains known bugs, so it has to 
    be considered as EXPERIMENTAL. I plan to gradually improve it in
    next versions.
    It supports only one share.
    It can be used to download or upload files or directories.
    It does not support locking, so files cannot be edited live.
    Currently, it should work with most Windows NT and Windows 2000
    clients.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.30.0 - 30-March-2005

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.29.0 - 21-February-2005
 ++ important ++
    As some of you noticed, netw project paused since January 1st.
    This is due to my professional/enterprise project where I have to
    do a lot of private work. It should end on september, so I expect
    to be back on netw on october. In the meantime, bugs will be
    corrected, but no major tool is expected. Note: don't worry, my
    boss is not forcing me to work on WE, but I want this project to
    take a giant step :-)

 ++ fixed bugs ++
  - In tool 210, a variable was not initialized. Tool did not work.

 ++ major evolutions ++
  - Tool 213 : Display a list of IP addresses
  - Tool 214 and 215 : Traceroute discovery. This tool draws a graph
    of remote network. For example :
      netwox 214 --ips 10.0.0.1-10.10.0.16 --tcpports "25,80" \
        --udpports "1,53" --icmp --resolve --verbose
  - Tool 216 : beep

 ++ minor evolutions ++
  - In uris found in HTML files, the leading and ending spaces,
    tabulations and newlines are ignored (not in specification, but
    behave like other browsers).
  - Most tools had a default timeout of 10 seconds. This was too
    small for loaded networks. User had to increase timeout on
    command line. Now it is 60 seconds.
  - A new bash script library permits to launch several tools
    simultaneously. It is in directory netwox-src/misc/launcher/.
    For example, when there is a list of 250 hosts to test, user
    creates a loop to run a tool on each IP address. However, when a
    host is down, a timeout occurs only after several seconds, and
    slows down all the tests. The launch library contains bash
    functions to run, for example, up to 5 simultaneous commands. It
    permits to shorter total test time.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.28.0 - 05-January-2005
 ++ fixed bugs ++
  - In tool 21, if --disp-decimal was set, binary was also displayed.
  - SMB share enumeration packet was not decoded if available shares
    was less than announced.
  - Function netwox_md_update caused a segmentation fault if it was
    previously called with data of size%64 != 0.
  - In uri canonization, only convert '+' to space in query part.

 ++ major evolutions ++
  - Tool 210 : web spider limited to requested directory.
  - Tool 211 : convert a web spidered filename to its url.
  - Tool 212 : indicates where web spider stored an url.

 ++ minor evolutions ++
  - SMB tools have a new parameter --verbose to display simple
    messages. It also decodes most common error codes.
  - Traceroute tools have a new parameter --resolve to resolve
    hostnames.

 ++ internal evolutions (not seen by end users) ++
  - Web spider improvements (faster and less restrictive) in md5
    filenames storage.
  - Due to changes in netwib sys/path, some functions were rewritten.

Version 5.27.0 - 30-November-2004
 ++ fixed bugs ++
    None in this version

 ++ major evolutions ++
    Implementation of SMB/CIFS protocol. This protocol is used for
    file and printer sharing under Windows. Netwox's implementation
    only supports file sharing.
    Currently, only clients are provided :
      tool 198: list shares
      tool 199: create a directory
      tool 200: delete a directory
      tool 201: rename a directory
      tool 202: list contents of a directory
      tool 203: delete a file
      tool 204: rename a file
      tool 205: get a file
      tool 206: put a file
      tool 207: recursively get a directory
      tool 208: recursively put a directory
      tool 209: recursively delete a directory
    Server is expected for version 5.28.0 of netwox.
    Note: This protocol is very big, which explains why netwox only
          had a few changes since 27th of september.

    Juan Manuel Palacios (jmpp at opendarwin dot org) packaged the
    Mac OS X centric DarwinPorts Portfiles for netwib, netwox and
    netwag (http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/). Portfiles can be
    retrieved by CVS, and will be available soon at :
      http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/ports


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.26.0 - 25-October-2004
 ++ fixed bugs ++
  - If url contains a fragment (http://server/#frag), it has to be
    suppressed (http://server/) to download the file. This worked
    with Apache, but IIS replied with a 400 error code.

 ++ documentation
    There are no big changes in this version. So, you can take time
    to read documentation. File netwox-doc_html/html/examples.html is
    the most important to read.
    You can also install and try netwag.

  - Tool 180: SNTP/NTP client displaying date/time.
  - Tool 181: SNTP/NTP server providing a central time to clients.
  - Tool 182: obtain the size of a web file.
  - Tool 183-5: TCP/UDP relays.
  - Tool 186: sleep for less than one second.
  - Tool 187: display date and time.
  - Tool 188: SYSLOG server
  - Tool 189: SMTP server logging commands and data.
  - Tool 190: A commonly requested feature.

 ++ minor evolutions ++
  - Searching description led to a lot of false positives. Now,
    search is only done in title and synonyms.
  - Traceroute tools have a new parameter --min-ttl to set starting
    TTL.

 ++ internal evolutions (not seen by end users) ++
    None in this version

 ++ note ++
  - Some tools require root privileges (for example capturing
    packets with tool 7). A bug occurring with root privileges can
    compromise the system. In order to protect system, programs
    generally separate privileges in two distinct process (or loose
    privileges if they are not needed anymore). This kind of
    architecture is too complicated to implement for simple tools
    such as netwox ones. If this worries you, netwox or netwag can
    be run in chroot jails. You can create your own jail, or take
    ideas from script misc/unix/chroot/chroot.sh (Linux). As a
    final note, tcpdump, Ethereal, nmap, etc are not separating
    privileges. So, they can also be added in the same jail. Another
    solution is to use capabilities.

 ++ major evolutions ++
  - Each tool have a detailed description. To see it, run
    "netwox number --help2" (for example "netwox 1 --help2").
    This description is also available in netwox-doc_html.
    If you encounter any error, or have some comments to add, please
    contact me.
  - Search feature (run "netwox", then press 3 key) improved to find
    more easily unknown tools.
    Search is done in title, description and synonyms (for example,
    searching for "capture" retrieves all tools containing "sniff").
    Moreover, if a word is not found, its root is searched (for
    example searching "spoofing" retrieves all tools containing
    "spoof").
    If you think a word is missing in a synonym list, please send me
    a mail.

    not duplicated.

 ++ major evolutions ++
  - Tool 168: FTP server. This is a basic implementation. It does not
    support multiuser, so if run as administrator file access is done
    with high privileges. This server can be run with user
    privileges by specifying an alternative port (instead of default
    21): "netwox 168 -P 1234 --login bob --password mypass". In this
    case, ftp client has to specify the port. For example in
    Mozilla: "ftp://server:1234/".

  - Ethernet addresses are automatically obtained from IP addresses
    when they start with '@'. For example "netwox 4 @192.168.0.1"
    obtains Ethernet address of 192.168.0.1 (ie 0:1:2:3:4:5) and runs
    "netwox 4 0:1:2:3:4:5".
  - Tools needing a password as parameter can use --kbd-parametername
    to set it without screen echo. For example
    "netwox 127 --kbd-password -i file1 -o file2" or
    "netwox 127 --kbd-p -i file1 -o file2".
  - Under unix shell, '?' char is expanded to match one character.
    So, "netwox 3 --?" did not work if a file named "--a" was present
    in current directory. This is very rare to have a file starting
    with '-', but it could bother users. This feature is still
    available, but it is no more displayed in help.

    and netwox_snmpvbl structures. I say "potential" because the bug
    cannot cause a bus error (memory alignment problem) even if it's
    here. This is due to netwib_buf_init_malloc() which returns
    aligned memory. We are lucky ;)

    is faster, but might cause problems on old systems ("command
    line too long"). If you encounter a such system, please contact
    me.

  - In the webspider, a new parameter (maxtotallen) defines the
    maximum pathname length. When this limit is reached, files
    are saved in a md5 root directory.

  - Function netwox_xor_gene_key worked only if keysize was greater
    than 1024.
  - In tcp virtual socket clients, session was not correctly closed
    when client initiated the close : the server was still in
    LASTACK state.
  - In tools 112, 113, 115 and 116 (FTP transfer), the mode was not
    explicitly set to binary.

    the number of simultaneous request to send. Please note if this
    value is too big, unexpected timeout will appear on slow
    networks (on a 10Mb LAN, the max seems to be around 130). By
    default, 20 simultaneous requests are sent.
