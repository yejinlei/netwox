-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 1:
  Problem synthesis:
    Display is slow.
  Environment affected by the problem:
    Windows
  What's causing the problem:
    In a msdos console, we cannot print more than 100 lines per seconds.
  Solution 1:
    Redirect output in a file:
      commandname > file
    However in this case, we do not see when data has to be entered.
  Solution 2:
    Use tools, or printprofiles, less verbose.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 2:
  Problem synthesis:
    At netwib end, the modem link stops.
  Environment affected by the problem:
    Windows 95 with a modem
  What's causing the problem:
    At the end of a program, references to unused object are freed.
    It's the case for the low level driver of WinPcap (packet.sys).
    Unfortunately, as explained in WinPcap FAQ, Windows also
    stops the modem connection. So, at the end of netwox, the phone
    line stops.
  Solution 1:
    Installation of:
     - Windows Sockets 2 Update, and
     - Dialup Networking 1.3 Update
    might resolv this problem. 
    Those updates are available here:
     - http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/downloads/contents/wuadmintools/s_wunetworkingtools/w95sockets2/default.asp
     - http://www.microsoft.com/Windows95/downloads/contents/WURecommended/S_WUNetworking/dun13win95/Default.asp
  Solution 2:
    You can contact WinPcap developers to help them to write a 
    driver/dll not having this problem.
    Additional note (march 2004): Windows 9x is no more supported by
    WinPcap developers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 3:
  Problem synthesis:
    Converting an IP address to a hostname returns a bad value.
  Environment affected by the problem:
    Windows XP
  What's causing the problem:
    Functions netwib_ip_init_buf(...NETWIB_IP_DECODETYPE_HN...) use
    gethostbyaddr(). However, there is a bug in WindowsXP's
    implementation of gethostbyaddr, as described in Knowledge Base
    Q317936 of Microsoft.
    This bug appears when DNSorWINS and NetBIOSoverTCPIP are activated.
  Solution:
    Patch Q317936 corrects this problem.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 4:
  Problem synthesis:
    Several tools of netwox doesn't seem to work.
  Environment affected by the problem:
    Windows
  What's causing the problem:
    Netwib depends on WinPcap. If WinPcap does not work, several
    features of netwib/netwox will not work.
    So, we have to ensure WinPcap works correctly.
  Solution:
    Install and test windump as described in INSTALL_FR.TXT.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 5:
  Problem synthesis:
    Sniff does not work with a modem
  Environment affected by the problem:
    Windows
  What's causing the problem:
    WinPCAP is not designed to work with a modem.
    File netwox-5.39.0-doc-html.tgz/en/examples.html lists systems where
    modems are supported.
  Solution:
    If your system does not support modems, try to apply WinPCAP solution:
      http://winpcap.polito.it/misc/dialup.htm

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 6:
  Problem synthesis:
    Popup: The dynamic library wpcap.dll was not found. 
    [Note: I'am not sure about the exact error message because I do not 
    have access to an English computer]
  Environment affected by the problem:
    Windows
  What's causing the problem:
    WinPCAP is not installed.
  Solution:
    Download and install WinPCAP as described in INSTALL.TXT
    or INSTALLWINDOWS.TXT.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 7:
  Problem synthesis:
    Why running 'netwox 1' ?
  Environment affected by the problem:
    All
  What's causing the problem:
    Obtaining the configuration (device, arp cache, routes) of the 
    local computer is an important step of netwib. Several tools need
    this configuration to be accurate.
    Different kinds of network cards, modems, operating systems, etc.
    exist. So, it's possible that your computer contains unrecognized
    hardware. In this case, several netwox tools would be 
    unusable.
    For these reasons, the first tool to use is 'netwox 1' to
    ensure correct configuration setting.
    Here is a correct example (taken on Linux):

    In this example, we see the loopback device (lo, or Lo0, number 1), and
    two network cards (eth0 and eth1, respectively number 2 and 3).
    Network card 2 has IP address 192.168.1.1, and network card 3 has two
    IP addresses (192.168.2.1 and 192.168.3.1).
    The arp table contains permanent entries, and the dynamic entry for
    the router 192.168.1.254.
    The routing table first contains entries to access local devices, then
    network connected to the local devices, and finally the default router
    192.168.1.254.
  Solution:
    As I cannot have access to your hardware, you have to send me information
    about your configuration in order to help netwib's improvements.
    Run:
      netwox 2 > resultfile
    Then, send me the file 'resultfile', along with configuration information
    (ifconfig, ipconfig /all, arp -a, route print, netstat -rn, 
    winipcfg /all /batch file.out, winipcfg, network card type, modem type,
    etc.). Thanks.

Problem 10:
  Problem synthesis:
    Error messages contains inaccurate hints
  Environment affected by the problem:
    All
  What's causing the problem:
    Implementing a cross platform compatible error handling is almost
    impossible (errno, h_errno, GetLatError, WSAGetLastError). The
    solution chosen in netwib is to leave those error codes untouched.
    So, if they were previously set by another error, this error
    will still be present. For example:
     Error 1099: error in foobar()
      hint: errno = 19 = No such device
      hint: h_errno = 2 = Host name lookup failure
    If function foobar sets errno read errno, else read h_errno.
  Solution:
    Just ignore the hint which seems inaccurate.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 11:
  Problem synthesis:
    Netwib is slow.
  Environment affected by the problem:
    All
  What's causing the problem:
    I choose to create a modular library, easy to use.
    One of the consequence is the high level structuration of netwib.
    So, it is slower than a low level programming interface.
  Solution 1:
    Using records (netwib_io_init_record_xyz), you can construct your packets,
    save them, and then send them.
  Solution 2:
    You can also use only low level functions of netwib, and create
    your specific code around.
    If its still too slow, you should not use netwib and use directly
    system's functions, or buy a new computer ;)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 12:
  Problem synthesis:
    Some tools does not fully work.
  Environment affected by the problem:
    All
  What's causing the problem:
    Netwox's development contains several branches, each one having its 
    own priority. I cannot develop everything in one day:). So, my 
    priorities might not be the same as yours.
    Moreover, only frequently used part of protocols are implemented.
  Solution 1:
    Read todo.txt to obtain list of action to be done.
  Solution 2:
    Read unimplemented.txt to obtain the list of unimplemented stuff.
  Solution 3:
    Contact-me to explain your needs.

Problem 15:
  Problem synthesis:
    The name "netwox539" is too long to enter.
  Environment affected by the problem:
    All
  What's causing the problem:
    I choose the name "netwox" followed by its version number. However,
    you may think that pressing those keys is too long.
  Solution:
    You just need to copy netwox539 or to create a link:
     - Unix:
        ln -s /usr/local/bin/netwox539 /usr/local/bin/nx
     - Windows:
        copy netwox539.exe nx.exe
