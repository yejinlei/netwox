 March2002/4.08 : idea for fixed length display of binary data in numeric
                  conversion tools.

 March2002/4.08 : idea for tools 248..251,319,320 (ping tools) : user

Sebastien Salladin <sebastien dot salladin at aql dot fr>
 March2002/4.08 : Tool 208 crashed, when no answer was received, 
                  because of a free() on an unallocated memory area.

Minos <minos at enib dot fr>

Contributor who wanted to be anonymously listed
 April2002/4.09 : bug in tools using lcrzo_device_value_pos(
                  LCRZO_DEVICE_TYPE_ONLYBOARDS, etc.) when there
                  is no Ethernet card in the computer.

Steven Vanberghen <svanberghen at expectra dot be>
 August2002/4.13 : Tool 286 cannot retrieve a FTP site having
                   a directory name containing space. Tool 409
		   uses another algorithm (walk through instead
                   of staying at the root), so it corrects the
                   problem.

Christophe Delahaye <christophe dot delahaye at aql dot fr>
 August2002/4.14 : In shared_http_appendm_authbasiclogpass and
                   shared_http_appendm_proxyauthbasiclogpass,
                   output parameter pdatasize was not set when login
                   and password were NULLs.
 October2002/4.16 : In tool 351, if user specified a bad tool
                    number, the displayed error was about tool 351
                    instead of the bad tool.
 October2002/4.16 : In tool 324, under Windows (except 2k and XP),
                    if the range contained an unreachable computer,
                    the tool stopped.
 November2002/4.17 : In tools 281..284, FTP transfers were done in
                     the default type of the server. So, with some
		     servers, ascii mode was used instead
                     of binary mode, and files were corrupted.
 2003,2004/5.x : Several usage suggestions which permitted to
                 improve tools. I cannot remember them all. A big
                 thanks to him.

Eric Sommer <esommer at cisco dot com>
 August2002/4.14 : In tools 97, 98, 99, 107, 105, 191, 193, 195,
                   197, 199, 201 and 203, client and server ports
                   were reverted.

Anand Jain <jainanand at rediffmail dot com>
 August2002/4.14 : In tool 134, if a class B network was used, 
                   edge addresses were not correct.
 Sept2002/4.15 : Tool 134 entered an infinite loop when used on
                 class B network.

"yigael" <yigael at berger-domain dot com>

 October2003/5.5.0 : Improvements in genemake file to support a more
                     generic installation.

Jens-Harald Johansen <Jens-Harald dot Johansen at hydro dot com>
 December2003/5.6.0 : Under Linux, when a network card had no IP
                      address, it was not possible to use it for
                      sniffing or spoofing. The problem was that
                      netwib didn't retrieve the associated
                      configuration (see netwib's changelog).

 April2004/5.15.0 : Report of files in netwib-5.14.0-bin_windows
                    which were generated using version 5.13.0 of netwib.
