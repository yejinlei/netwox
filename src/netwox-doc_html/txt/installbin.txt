Note : if you encounter problems, read ./doc/probleminstall.txt

There are 2 steps :
 - install winpcap version >= 3.0
 - install netwox


                 -------------------------------
                 |       STEP 1 : winpcap      |
                 -------------------------------

If winpcap isn't installed on your system, download it from :
  http://winpcap.polito.it/
Version 3.0, or superior, is needed.
Follow the given instructions in order to install it.

After installing winpcap, you should test if it is working properly.
If you do not want to bother testing, you can directly go to step 2.
To test winpcap's installation, you need to download windump :
  http://windump.polito.it/
Then, in a console window, if you enter "\directory...\windump",
network packet will be displayed (for example, you can ping another
computer and see the packets).
Once windump displays network packets, you can go to step2.

If you have a problem downloading, installing winpcap, or running 
windump, read the faq at :
  http://winpcap.polito.it/
  http://windump.polito.it/
If you still have a problem, contact Winpcap's developers.
I cannot help you, because I do not maintain this code.

Note: If winpcap is not installed, netwib will work, but without
      sniffing or spoofing features.

                 ----- Windows 95, 98, Me -----
Generally, %WINDIR% is "C:\Windows".

You have to :
 - copy "netwib539.dll" to "%WINDIR%\System\netwib539.dll".
 - open a ms-dos console : Start - Run - "command"
 - in this console, enter :
     echo %PATH%
       This command lists the directories in your path. For example,
       "%WINDIR%\Command\" is in your path.
     exit
       This command closes the ms-dos console
 - copy "netwox539.exe" in one of the directories of your path
   (for example you can chose "%WINDIR%\Command\")
