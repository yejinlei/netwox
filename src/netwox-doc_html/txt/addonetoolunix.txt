
This file explains how to add a tool in netwox.

If you want to compile netwox, you're not reading the good file. Read 
../INSTALLUNIX.TXT.

If you want to compile a small program with netwib, it's easier than 
what's explained here : read netwib-5.39.0-src/doc/compilunix.txt.


For example, to add tool number 4, modifying tool 3, the procedure is :
 - cp tools/000003.c tools/000004.c
 - edit tools/000004.c and replace "000004" by "000003"
 - modify tools/000004.c to match your needs
 - add two lines in tools.h
 - add one line in tools.list
 - run ./genemake
 - run make

If this tool needs a new module named foobar, also do :
 - vi modules/foobar.c (to create it)
 - vi modules/foobar.h (to create it)
 - add module in modules.h
 - run ./genemake
 - run make
