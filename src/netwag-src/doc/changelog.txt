Version 5.29.0 - 21-February-2005
 ++ important ++
    As some of you noticed, netw project paused since January 1st.
    This is due to my professional/enterprise project where I have to
    do a lot of private work. It should end on september, so I expect
    to be back on netw on october. In the meantime, bugs will be
    corrected, but no major tool is expected. Note: don't worry, my
    boss is not forcing me to work on WE, but I want this project to
    take a giant step :-)

 ++ notes ++
  - Under Unix, when netwag is installed, no desktop icon/menu is
    added. Icons are in netwag-src/misc/unix/ico directory (named
    ico_netw-16x16.xpm and ico_netw-32x32.xpm). You have to add a
    desktop icon/menu pointing to /usr/local/bin/netwag. As the exact
    procedure depends on desktop (Gnome, KDE, FVWM, etc.), it can
    be complicated, so it is not done during installation process.
  - Control-K key binding permits to remove text from current
    position to end of field. For example, in Form notebook, an entry
    may contain 1.2.3.4, and you want to replace it by 5.6.7.8: click
    at entry beginning, press Control-K, write/paste 5.6.7.8.

  - In Form notebook, several new parameter types have their own
    history (hostname, newsgroup, login, etc.).
  - In Running notebook, a new button "crush" permits to crush old
    lines (>50000 lines by default), in order to limit memory usage.

Version 5.22.0 - 15-August-2004
 ++ fixed bugs ++
  - In Search notebook, if user double-clicked on a line, and then
    slightly moved (up or down) before Form notebook had time to
    appear, the retrieved tool was the bad one. This caused an error
    message to appear.

 ++ major evolutions ++
  - Search feature improved to find more easily unknown tools.
    Search is done in title, description and synonyms (for example,
    searching for "capture" retrieves all tools containing "sniff").
  - Detailed description of tools is available in Help notebook. If
    you encounter any error, or have some comments to add, please
    contact me.

Version 5.21.0 - 1-August-2004
 ++ fixed bugs ++
  - When no tool is selected, Help and Form notebooks display an help
    message. This message was about "Change tool" button which was
    renamed "Update" some time ago. So help message didn't really
    help :)

  - Now, genemake does not check if wish really works. This caused
    problem for automatic installers, or packages generation.
  - XPM icons are available under src/compil/unix/ico directory. They
    permit to create nice menus. They are not used during
    installation process, but can be configured by hand depending on
    window manager (Gnome, KDE, fvwm, etc.). Package maintainers
    can also use them.

 ++ related work ++
  - Donnie Werner created netwagui for Windows containing netwib,
    netwox, netwag and Tcl/Tk. It permits quick installation on
    computers without Tcl/Tk. Available for download at:
    http://exploitlabs.com/files/woods/netwagui.rar

    %TEMP%/netwag.ses. Now, it is saved in %APPDATA%/netwag.ses.
    To retrieve old session, just copy it from %TEMP%/netwag.ses to
    %APPDATA%/netwag.ses or open it from netwag's menu.

  - When releasing 5.16.1, micro version (.1) was not incremented
    everywhere.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.16.1 - 11-May-2004
 ++ bugs fixed ++
  - Tk version <= 8.2, does not support parameter -activebackground
    for labels.

Version 5.16.0 - 10-May-2004
 ++ bugs fixed ++
    None in this version

 ++ major evolutions ++
  - Support for wheel mouses. Tcl/Tk support for MouseWheel is
    strange to me (focus/selection needed under Windows, strictmotif
    variable under Unix, etc.). Now, everything works fine on my
    computers, but if you encounter problems, please contact me.
  - Rewrite of most Form notebook code. Fields support dynamic help.
    Fields are aligned. Tab key skips to next field. History of
    previously entered values is available.
  - Several tools can run simultaneously. History of run tools
    data is kept. Tools can be easily run again.
  - A new button named "Interrupt" appears in remote information
    notebook. It permits to interrupt a long name resolution for
    example.
  - In form Notebook, a new entry type was created to enter
    passwords, which are not displayed on screen. They are not
    viewable, but while netwag is running, they are stored in Tcl
    memory, so an user with access to netwag can obtain passwords.
    Do not leave your computer unattended while netwag is running (as
    for any other program), so lock your screen. Note: we could
    destroy them just after tool start, but if we want to run the
    same tool several times, we'd have to regenerate password
    each time.
  Note: this version provides several new features. Don't hesitate
        to read lessons in netwag-5.16.0-doc_html.tgz, or
        to activate dynamic help (Options menu - Dynamic help).

 ++ minor evolutions ++
  - When a major problem occurs (netwox not found), do not restart
    with a blank session, loosing previous session information.
  - Better display on slow computers.
  - Lot of small improvements.

 ++ internal evolutions (not seen by end users) ++
  - Rewrite of most functions running shell commands.
