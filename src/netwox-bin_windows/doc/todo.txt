                      --------------------------------

Simple protocols:
 - POP3 (client, rfc 1939)
 - IMAP4 (client, rfc 3501)
 ? SOCKS (rfc 1928, 1929)

Complex protocols:
 - LDAP ([v3]rfc 2251-56, 2829-30, 3377 and [v2]rfc 1777-79, 1959-60)
 ? RPC (rfc 1831)
 ? NFS (rfc 3530, 3010)

Other tools:
 - Implement cookies in HTTP protocol.
 - Implement vstack.c
 - Test a firewall with a computer having two network cards. A file
   describes allowed rules. The tool checks them, and their variations.
 - Backdoor using TCP ACK, ICMP ping, UDP dns, etc to communicate.

Note about NETWIB_BUF_FLAGS_SENSITIVE:
 Netwox uses parameters from command line, so wiping memory is not
 very efficient because they can be seen from a ps or in the argv
 array. I don't plan to implement a very strict sensitive memory
 management in netwox. However, it could be done :
  - in FTP, HTTP, etc. modules (search for password) [I did a quick
    first usage, but it have to be improved]
  - in crypto modules
 The only real usage, is when netwox modules are extracted from netwox
 and inserted in another GPL program.
