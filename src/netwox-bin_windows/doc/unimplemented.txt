                 |   UNIMPLEMENTED IN NETWOX   |
                 -------------------------------

Netwox's objective is to contain a lot of tools.
Some are not fully implemented at 100%. Indeed, some features
are not frequently needed.

This file describes features which are not expected to be
implemented. File todo.txt includes the ones which are planned
for next months.

* IP OPTIONS :
   Only options of RFC 791 are implemented. Others, are dealt as
   a byte array.

* Sniffer :
   Decoded protocols are :
    - Ethernet
    - IP
    - IP options (rfc 791)
    - ICMP (rfc 792)
    - UDP
    - TCP
    - ARP/RARP

* Performance :
   Most tools are monothread. So, they are not very fast to do
   repetitive tasks.
