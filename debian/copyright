Because of SONAME changes with every release, netwib library has been 
integrated into the netwox package and is not available as an external 
package. In addition netwox uses -rpath switch for gcc to hide library 
into /usr/lib/netwib/ directory. This way there is no documentation 
nor headers for library available. Only credits.txt file has been included.
